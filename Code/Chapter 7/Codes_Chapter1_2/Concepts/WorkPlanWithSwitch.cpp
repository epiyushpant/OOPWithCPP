/*

This program uses a switch statement to display a work plan based on the day of the week.
The user inputs a number from 1 to 7, and the program outputs the corresponding day's activities. 


Improved Readability – Each case is clearly structured. 
More Efficient – switch jumps directly to the matched case. 
Less Code Duplication – Easier to manage than multiple if-else conditions. 
Works Best for Fixed Inputs – Ideal for cases like menu selection, weekdays, or grading systems.

However, if-else is still useful when handling complex comparisons or ranges (e.g., checking for temperatures, scores, or conditions that switch can't handle).
