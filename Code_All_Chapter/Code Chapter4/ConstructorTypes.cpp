// Small practice variation: example adjusted for practice.
// Constructor types in C++ are used to initialize objects of a class. They can be defined in various ways, including default constructors,'
// parameterized constructors, and copy constructors. 
//Constructors can also be overloaded to provide different ways of initializing an object based on the parameters passed.

// This code demonstrates different types of constructors in C++: default, parameterized, and copy constructors.
// Constructors are special member functions that are automatically called when an object of a class is created.
// They are used to initialize the object's data members and can be overloaded to provide different ways of initializing an object.
// Constructors are essential for ensuring that objects are in a valid state when they are created.
// They can also be used to enforce certain constraints on the object's state, such as ensuring that
// the age is a positive integer or that the name is not empty.
// Constructors are a fundamental part of object-oriented programming in C++ and play a crucial role in the lifecycle of an object.
// They help in encapsulating the initialization logic within the class, making the code cleaner and more maintainable.
