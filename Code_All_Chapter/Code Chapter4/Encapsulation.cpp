// Encapsulation in C++ is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, or class.
// It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which is a means of preventing unintended interference and misuse of the methods and data.
// Encapsulation is achieved using access specifiers: public, private, and protected.
// It allows for data hiding, which is a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming.
// Encapsulation is used to protect the integrity of the data and to hide the internal state of an object from the outside world.
// It is a key feature of object-oriented programming that promotes modularity and maintainability of code
