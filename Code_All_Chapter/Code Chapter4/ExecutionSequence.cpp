// grandfather -> father - > child
// Constructor calls: Grandfather -> Father -> Child
// Destructor calls: Child -> Father -> Grandfather
// This sequence ensures that the base class constructors are called before the derived class constructors,
// and the derived class destructors are called before the base class destructors.
// This is important for proper initialization and cleanup of resources in an inheritance hierarchy.
