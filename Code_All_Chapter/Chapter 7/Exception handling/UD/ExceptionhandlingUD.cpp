// Small practice variation: example adjusted for practice.
/*
When we talk about user-defined types in the context of exception handling,
 it usually means throwing and catching objects of classes (custom types you define) 
instead of just built-in types like int or char.

Note 
Instead of throwing simple values, you can throw instances of your own classes.
This allows more meaningful error information and custom behaviors.
Usually, user-defined exception classes store error details, provide member functions,
and sometimes derive from std::exception.
